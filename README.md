Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the motor system of our body is affected. 
 In our work the accuracy of three machine learning algorithms (Extreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine) are investigated as two important algorithms for the prediction of Parkinson's disease. 
We used the dataset created by Max Little from University of Oxford which contains biomedical measurement of voice of 31 people .
The whole Parkinson dataset is split into two parts, one part is for training and other for testing our machine learning model. 
We take 80% of the dataset to train the Support Vector Machine Model and 20% to test the model and we get an accuracy of 87.17% using Support Vector Machine model. 
Similarly Extreme Gradient Boosting Model was also trained and tested and accuracy of this model is 82.05 % . 
We have also built a predictive model based on these algorithms and the output of this model will help in showcasing the early detection and can be able to increase the lifespan of the patients suffering from this disease with proper medications and treatments.
